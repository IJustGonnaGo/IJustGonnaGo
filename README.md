## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Aurelio Scott, an Undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Technology and Cybersecurity. 
My two projects I will be working on throughout the year are my Project 4 for 1181 otherwise known as Computer Science 2. Project 4 is the most difficult and therefore most significant of the projects for the class.
A personal project I will be working on is to create a software program that does something. By this I mean an executable for windows that will actually do something, which would be a first creation of mine.
